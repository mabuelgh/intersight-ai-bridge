Nimbus Orchard

Nimbus Orchard builds micro-ecosystem kits and smart planters that turn balconies, rooftops, and office corners into year-round food gardens. Our plug-and-play kits pair resilient heirloom seeds with soil pods, self-watering modules, and a tiny AI that learns each plant’s rhythm. We help busy cityfolk grow real food, reduce their carbon footprint, and taste the season — without the mess or guesswork. Tagline: Harvest more from less, making urban nature useful.
