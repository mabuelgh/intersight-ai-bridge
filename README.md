# Intersight AI Bridge

**Intersight AI Bridge** simplifies the initial installation and usage of Cisco UCS devices for AI workloads.  

> **Note**: Starting from **Step 3**, these tools can also be used on any Linux system, even without Cisco UCS hardware.

This project provides scripts and configurations to:  
1. Deploy a **Server Profile** on Cisco Intersight.  
2. Install an **Operating System** through the Intersight OS Install feature (requires an *Advantage* license, otherwise can be done manually).  
3. Set up your environment for GPU-based AI workloads with three possible use cases:  
   - **Chatbot with VLLM + OpenWebUI**  
   - **Chatbot with Text Generation WebUI**  
   - **Chatbot with VLLM + Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  


## Getting Started

### Step 1: Deploy the Server Profile
*Detailed instructions for deploying a Server Profile with a JSON provided config file on Cisco Intersight will be added here soon.*  
(Can be skipped if you prefer manual configuration or are not using Intersight.)


### Step 2: Install the Operating System through Intersight OS Install feature
(Can be skipped if you prefer manual installation or are not using Intersight.)  

1. Modify the cfg file to your environement, recommended things to change:
- Hashed passsword and default username
- Network interface settings : remove or change VLAN, put DHCP mode or manual IP
- Change the Proxy address
- Adjust the timezone

2. Download the recommended ISO
- [Ubuntu](https://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/22.04/)
- [Cisco CSU](https://software.cisco.com/download/home/286331885/type/283137444/release/6.3(2c))

Recommended ISOs:  
- `ubuntu-22.04.2-live-server-amd64.iso`  
- `ucs-scu-6.3.2c.iso`

3. Use the Software Repository of Intersight
- Open Intersight
- Go to System > Software Repository
- Add the OS Image Link of the downloaded Ubuntu (you can put the image on any NFS, CIFS or HTTP like EasyUCS or IMM Transition Tool)
- Add the SCU Link of the downloaded SCU (you can put the image on any NFS, CIFS or HTTP like EasyUCS or IMM Transition Tool)
- Upload the OS Configuration file (the cfg file modified in step 1)
- Go to the target server, go to Action, select "Install Operating System"
- Select the OS, select "Custom" configuration, select the cfg file, select the SCU, select the installation target "M.2 MStorBootVd" and Install

**Note**: This process will take some time.

### Step 3: Requirements Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository (make sure to export the proxy if needed) and run the setup script:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mabuelgh/intersight-ai-bridge
   cd intersight-ai-bridge
   chmod +x *.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```
   **Note**: This action will conclude with a reboot.

2. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   cd intersight-ai-bridge
   ./checking.sh
   ```
   This process will trigger the creation of a Docker container. It will then display your CPUs inside the container to confirm the Nvidia container toolkit installation.

## Use Case Scenarios

After setup, choose one of the following scenarios:

### 1. Chatbot: VLLM + OpenWebUI
Launch VLLM with OpenWebUI:  
```bash
./scenario1.sh
```
**Note**: If not done automatically, select your model on the top left corner of OpenWebUI.

### 2. Chatbot: Text Generation WebUI
Launch with the Text Generation WebUI project:  
```bash
./scenario2.sh
```
**Note**: You may need to load your model in the settings page before using it.


### 3. Chatbot: VLLM + RAG (File Context)
Launch VLLM with RAG for file-based context:  
```bash
./scenario3.sh
```
#### ðŸ“– Example Questions to ask based on the RAG files in the project
Once running, you can ask questions such as:
- *"When was Chronos Innovations created?"*  
- *"What's the business of Nimbus Orchard?"*  
- *"What is LuminaTech Solutions?"*  

## Notes
- Monitor GPUs with commands: "nvidia-smi" & "nvtop"
- Steps 1 and 2 are optional if youâ€™re not using Cisco Intersight.  
- Scripts are modularâ€”feel free to adapt them for your environment.  

## Features and improvements to come
- Complete Step 1 Instructions
- Put scenario 3 python utilisation inside a container instead of on the OS directly
- Create a scenario 4 to showcase GPU activity
